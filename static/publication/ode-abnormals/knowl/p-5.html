<p>The Sard Conjecture is that the set of critical values of the endpoint map should have zero measure, i.e., most points should not be reachable from a fixed initial point with an abnormal curve. The set of critical values is known as the <dfn class="terminology">abnormal set</dfn>. A more restricted variant is the Minimizing Sard Conjecture, where the abnormal curves are in addition required to be length minimizers. As with the regularity problem, several partial results exist. For instance, the minimizing abnormal set is contained in a closed nowhere dense set <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/Agrachev-2009-points_of_smoothness.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 2: Any sub-Riemannian metric has points of smoothness">[2]</a>, the abnormal set is a proper algebraic or analytic subvariety in Carnot groups and polarized groups of particular types <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/LMOPV-2016-sard.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 17: Sard property for the endpoint map on some Carnot groups">[17]</a>, and in dimension 3 the abnormal set is a countable union of semianalytic curves <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/BFPR-2018-3d_Sard.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 4: Strong Sard conjecture and regularity of singular minimizing geodesics for analytic sub-riemannian structures in dimension 3">[4]</a>.</p>
