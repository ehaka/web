<p>The naive upper bound computed in step <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/algorithm-4-sufficient-step.html" title="Item 4">4</a> of <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/algorithm-abnormal-trajectory.html" title="Algorithm 5.1">Algorithm 5.1</a> for the nilpotency step \(s\) as a function of the rank and degree of the polynomials is in general horribly inefficient, see the explosive growth already for the smallest ranks \(r\) and degrees \(d\) listed in <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/table-nilpotency-step-bounds.html" title="Figure 5.3">Figure 5.3</a>. In practice, solutions are found in much smaller nilpotency steps, see <a href="section-examples.html#example-lorenz-butterfly" class="internal" title="Subsection 5.4: The Lorenz butterfly (r3s13)">Subsection 5.4</a> for a particularly egregious example where the a priori upper bound is \(s=724\text{,}\) but the system has nontrivial solutions already for \(s=13\text{.}\) For practical computations it is more efficient to form the linear system in smaller steps \(s'\leq s\) and increase \(s'\) one by one until a nontrivial solution is found.</p>
<p>In fact, computations suggest that there exists a much more refined bound \(s=s(d)\) independent from the rank \(r\text{.}\) Linear ODEs with randomly chosen coefficients in ranks 2, 3, and 4 always had solutions in step \(s=7\text{,}\) despite the a priori bounds for \(s\) being 11, 89, and 386 respectively. Similarly the quadratic ODEs of <a href="section-examples.html#example-the-hawaiian-earring" class="internal" title="Subsection 5.3: The Hawaiian earring (r2s13)">Subsection 5.3</a> and <a href="section-examples.html#example-lorenz-butterfly" class="internal" title="Subsection 5.4: The Lorenz butterfly (r3s13)">Subsection 5.4</a> in ranks 2 and 3 both have solutions in step \(s=13\) despite the increase of the a priori bound from \(s=38\) to \(s=724\text{.}\)</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-examples.html#remark-algorithm-nonsharp">in-context</a></span>
