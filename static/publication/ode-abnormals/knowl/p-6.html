<p>Recently, both the regularity and Sard problems have seen progress through the study of abnormal curves from a dynamical systems viewpoint. A class of potentially minimizing abnormal curves in rank 2 sub-Riemannian structures was proved to have at least \(C^1\)-regularity <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/BCJPS-2018-rank_2_abnormals.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 3: On the regularity of abnormal minimizers for rank 2 sub-Riemannian structures">[3]</a>, and the Sard Conjecture was proved in Carnot groups of rank 2 step 4 and rank 3 step 3 <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/Boarotto-Vittone-2020-dynamical_sard.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 8: A dynamical approach to the Sard problem in Carnot groups">[8]</a>. The idea common to both articles is that differentiating the identities defining abnormal curves leads to an ODE system that some reparametrization of the control of the abnormal curve will satisfy. Then using normal forms for the resulting ODEs, the authors of <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/BCJPS-2018-rank_2_abnormals.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 3: On the regularity of abnormal minimizers for rank 2 sub-Riemannian structures">[3]</a> and <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/Boarotto-Vittone-2020-dynamical_sard.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 8: A dynamical approach to the Sard problem in Carnot groups">[8]</a> were able to prove their respective claims by studying trajectories of finitely many explicit ODE systems.</p>
