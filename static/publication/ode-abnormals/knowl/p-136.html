<p>Finding an explicit covector also in the cases where the generic one vanishes would require a more careful look at the computation to solve the linear system over the fraction field \(\fractionfield{\vectorparam{\freeparam}}\text{.}\) In the standard Gauss-Jordan algorithm, each attempted division by a nonconstant polynomial \(P\) splits the consideration into two cases: the points within the variety \(P=0\) and those outside. Inside the variety, the polynomial is replaced by zero and the Gauss-Jordan procedure continues. Outside the variety, the polynomial \(P\) can freely be used as a denominator. Expanding away the denominators in the end leads to finitely many different reduced echelon forms in distinct semialgebraic varieties, with each echelon form consisting of coefficients in the polynomial ring \(\polyring{\vectorparam{\freeparam}}\text{.}\) Nontrivial elements of the solution space can then be read off from the echelon form, again splitting into cases based on the vanishing of the coefficients. This procedure defines an admissible abnormal covector \(\covector\) as a semialgebraic function \(\covector(\vectorparam{\freeparam})\text{.}\)</p>
