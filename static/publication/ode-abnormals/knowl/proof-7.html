<p>The claim will be proved by induction on the layer \(m\text{.}\) The base case \(m=1\) follows from the <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/lemma-curves-in-abnormal-variety-are-abnormal.html" title="Lemma 2.2">characterization</a> of abnormality by abnormal polynomials. Suppose that the claim holds up to some layer \(m\lt s-1\) and suppose that</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation}
\abnormalpolynomial{X}{\covector}\circ\gamma\equiv 0\tag{3.2}
\end{equation}
</div>
<p data-braille="continuation">for every \(X\in \lielayer{\mathfrak{g}}{m+1}\text{,}\) and that at least one of the polynomials \(\abnormalpolynomial{X}{\covector}\) is nonzero.</p>
<p>By the explicit formula of <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/lemma-abnormal-polynomials-in-exponential-coordinates.html" title="Lemma 2.5">Lemma 2.5</a>, the abnormal polynomials \(\abnormalpolynomial{X}{\covector}\) for \(X\in \lielayer{\mathfrak{g}}{m+1}\) do not depend on the components of degree less than \(m+1\) of the covector \(\covector\text{.}\) Hence without loss of generality it will be assumed that \(\covector(\lielayer{\mathfrak{g}}{m}) = 0\text{.}\)</p>
<p>Fix an arbitrary \(Y\in\lielayer{\mathfrak{g}}{m}\text{.}\) By <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/lemma-derivatives-of-abnormal-polynomials.html" title="Lemma 2.16">Lemma 2.16</a>, the horizontal derivatives for \(X\in\lielayer{\mathfrak{g}}{1}\) of the abnormal polynomial \(\abnormalpolynomial{Y}{\covector}\) are abnormal polynomials \(\abnormalpolynomial{[X,Y]}{\covector}\text{.}\) Since \([X,Y]\in \lielayer{\mathfrak{g}}{m+1}\text{,}\) assumption <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/eq-abnormal-vanishing-layer.html" title="Equation 3.2">(3.2)</a> implies that the abnormal polynomial \(\abnormalpolynomial{Y}{\covector}\) is constant along the horizontal curve \(\gamma\text{.}\)</p>
<p>The property \(\covector(\lielayer{\mathfrak{g}}{m}) = 0\) implies that \(\abnormalpolynomial{Y}{\covector}(\identity{G}) = 0\text{.}\) Moreover, by assumption \(\identity{G}\in\overline{\gamma((a,b))}\text{,}\) so by continuity of the polynomial \(\abnormalpolynomial{Y}{\covector}\text{,}\) it follows that \(\abnormalpolynomial{Y}{\covector}\circ\gamma\equiv 0\text{.}\) Since \(Y\in\lielayer{\mathfrak{g}}{m}\) was arbitrary, the inductive step is complete, and the claim follows.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-abnormality-of-ode-trajectories.html#proof-7">in-context</a></span>
