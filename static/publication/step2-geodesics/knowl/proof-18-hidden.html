<body><article class="hiddenproof"><p>Let \(\varphi\colon (H,d_H)\hookrightarrow (G,d_G)\) be an isometric embedding. Since left-translations are isometries, it suffices to consider the case when the map \(\varphi\) preserves the identity element, and prove that such an isometric embedding is a homomorphism.</p>
<p>Consider an arbitrary point \(h\in H\) and vector \(X\in V_1^H\text{.}\) The horizontal line \(t\mapsto h\exp(tX)\) is an infinite geodesic with speed \(\norm{X}_H\) through the point \(h\in H\text{.}\) The image of the line under the isometric embedding \(\varphi\) is an infinite geodesic in the group \(G\) through the point \(\varphi(h)\) with exactly the same speed. By <a data-knowl="./knowl/cor-homogeneous-group-geodesics-are-lines.html" title="Corollary 1.2">Corollary 1.2</a> all infinite geodesics in the group \(G\) are horizontal lines, so there exists some vector \(Y\in V_1^G\) (a priori depending on the point \(h\) and the vector \(X\)) with \(\norm{X}_H=\norm{Y}_G\) such that</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\varphi(h\exp(tX)) = \varphi(h)\exp(tY)\quad\forall t\in\RR\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Consider then the two parallel infinite geodesics \(t\mapsto \exp(tX)\) and \(t\mapsto h\exp(tX)\) with speed \(\norm{X}_H\text{.}\) Repeating the previous consideration, since the map \(\varphi\) was assumed to preserve the identity, there exists another horizontal direction \(Z\in V_1^G\) such that \(\varphi(\exp(tX))= \exp(tZ)\text{.}\) By <a data-knowl="./knowl/lemma-sublinear-geodesics.html" title="Lemma 7.1">Lemma 7.1</a>, the two geodesics in the group \(H\) are at a sublinear distance from each other. Since \(\varphi\) is an isometric embedding, the image lines in the group \(G\) must also be at a sublinear distance from each other, so applying <a data-knowl="./knowl/lemma-sublinear-geodesics.html" title="Lemma 7.1">Lemma 7.1</a> in the converse direction shows that necessarily \(Y=Z\text{.}\) That is, the vector \(Y\in V_1^G\) does not depend on the point \(h\in H\text{,}\) but instead only on the vector \(X\in V_1^H\text{.}\)</p>
<p>The above shows that there is a well defined map \(\varphi_*\colon V_1^H\to V_1^G\) such that \(\varphi(h\exp(X)) = \varphi(h)\exp(\varphi_* X)\text{.}\) In particular,</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation}
\varphi(h_1h_2) = \varphi(h_1)\varphi(h_2)\quad \forall h_1\in H\;\forall h_2\in\exp(V_1^H)\text{.}\tag{7.1}
\end{equation}
</div>
<p>Since the group \(H\) is stratified, the subset \(\exp(V_1^H)\) generates the entire group \(H\text{.}\) That is, any element \(h\in H\) can be written as a finite product of elements in \(\exp(V_1^H)\text{.}\) Applying the identity <a data-knowl="./knowl/eq-partial-homomorphism.html" title="Equation 7.1">(7.1)</a> repeatedly using such decompositions shows that the map \(\varphi\) is a homomorphism.</p></article></body>
