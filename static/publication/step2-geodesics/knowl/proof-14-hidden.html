<p>In Theorem 1.1 of <a data-knowl="./knowl/Le_Donne-2015-metric_characterization.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 10: A metric characterization of Carnot groups">[10]</a> sub-Finsler Carnot groups are characterized as the only geodesic metric spaces that are locally compact, isometrically homogeneous, and admit a dilation. Therefore it suffices to verify that the length metric associated to a homogeneous distance satisfies these properties.</p>
<p>The claims of isometric homogeneity and admitting a dilation follow directly from the corresponding properties of the <a data-knowl="./knowl/def-homogeneous-distance.html" title="Definition 2.3">metric</a> \(d\text{.}\) Namely, since left-translations are isometries of the metric \(d\text{,}\) they preserve the length of curves, and hence are also isometries of the length metric \(d_\ell\text{.}\) Similarly since dilations scale the length of curves linearly, they are dilations for the length metric \(d_\ell\text{.}\)</p>
<p>Finiteness of the length metric \(d_\ell\) follows from the stratification assumption: each element \(g\in G\) can be written as a product of elements in \(\exp(V_1)\) and the horizontal lines \(t\mapsto \exp(tX)\) are all geodesics. Therefore concatenation of suitable horizontal line segments defines a finite length curve from the identity \(e\) to any desired point \(g\text{.}\) It follows that the length metric \(d_\ell\) determines a well defined homogeneous distance on \(G\text{,}\) so by  Proposition 3.5 of <a data-knowl="./knowl/Le_Donne-2017-carnot_primer.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 11: A primer on Carnot groups: homogenous groups, Carnot-Carathéodory spaces, and regularity of their isometries">[11]</a> it induces the manifold topology of \(G\text{.}\) In particular \((G,d_\ell)\) is a boundedly compact length space, so it is a geodesic metric space (see  Corollary 2.5.20 of <a data-knowl="./knowl/Burago-Burago-Ivanov-2001-metric_geometry.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 6: A course in metric geometry">[6]</a>). Applying  Theorem 1.1 of <a data-knowl="./knowl/Le_Donne-2015-metric_characterization.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 10: A metric characterization of Carnot groups">[10]</a> shows that \((G,d_\ell)\) is a sub-Finsler Carnot group.</p></article><article class="case"><h6 class="heading">(ii).</h6>
<p>The lengths of all rectifiable curves in the original metric \(d\) and its associated length metric \(d_\ell\) always agree (see  Proposition 2.3.12 of <a data-knowl="./knowl/Burago-Burago-Ivanov-2001-metric_geometry.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 6: A course in metric geometry">[6]</a>). In particular, the claim that the geodesics of \((G,d)\) are geodesics of \((G,d_\ell)\) follows.</p></article><article class="case"><h6 class="heading">(iii).</h6>
<p>The horizontal projection \(\pi\colon (G,d)\to V_1\) is a submetry both for the sub-Finsler norm \(\norm{\cdot}_{SF}\) (by definition) and for the projection norm \(\norm{\cdot}_d\) (by <a data-knowl="./knowl/lemma-projection-is-submetry.html" title="Lemma 2.5">Lemma 2.5</a>). Hence the norms \(\norm{\cdot}_{SF}\) and \(\norm{\cdot}_d\) have exactly the same balls, so \(\norm{\cdot}_{SF} = \norm{\cdot}_d\text{.}\)</p></article></article></body>
