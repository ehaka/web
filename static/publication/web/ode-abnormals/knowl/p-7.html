<p>One reason for the success of the previous two articles was that the dynamical systems were not completely arbitrary, but had some properties that helped simplify the systems, such as the linear part being a traceless matrix. The goal of this paper is to study the scope of these dynamical systems within the setting of Carnot groups. The underlying questions motivating this research are:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>Which dynamical systems can arise as the ODE systems of abnormal curves in Carnot groups?</li>
<li>Which curves in \(\RR^r\) are the horizontal projections of abnormal curves in Carnot groups of rank \(r\text{?}\)</li>
</ul>
<p data-braille="continuation">The main result of this paper is that without fixing a specific Carnot group to study, there are essentially no restrictions on the possible dynamics of abnormal trajectories.</p>
