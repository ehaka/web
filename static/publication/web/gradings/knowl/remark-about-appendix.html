<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">(Ville added this remark as an attempt to contain the relevant information of the appendix, to kill it then). There is another approach that could be used in the place of <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/algorithm-positivisable-Zk.html" title="Algorithm 3.7: Positive realization">Algorithm 3.7</a> avoiding the constuction of universal realisation. Such an approach is motivated by <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">[cross-reference to target(s) "example-non-pos-grading-for-heisenberg" missing]</code></p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">The <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/def-grading.html" title="Definition 2.1">grading</a> in the example does not admit a positive realization: suppose by contradiction that there is an injection \(\{a,b,c,d\} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}\) that gives a positive realization. The bracket relations of the Lie algebra imply the equations \(a+c=d\) and \(b+d=c\text{,}\) which are impossible for strictly positive <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/def-grading.html" title="Definition 2.1">weights</a>. Here the non-existence of a positive realization is found simply by considering the equations implied by the bracket relations of the <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/def-grading.html" title="Definition 2.1">layers</a>.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">In general, a grading can be <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/def-realization.html" title="Definition 2.6">realized</a> over some abelian group \(A\) with the set of weights \(\{\lambda_1,\ldots,\lambda_k\}\) if and only if certain system of equations of the type \(\lambda_i + \lambda_j = \lambda_h\) has a solution \((\lambda_1,\ldots,\lambda_k)\) whose components are all distinct. This system consists of equations coming from the non-trivial bracket relations among the <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/def-realization.html" title="Definition 2.6">layers</a> of the grading, see step <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/alg-grading-relations2.html" title="Item 2">2</a> of <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/algorithm-integer-vector-grading.html" title="Algorithm 2.8: Universal realization">Algorithm 2.8</a>. A positive realization exists if and only if there is a solution in the group \(A=\mathbb{R}\) with all weights strictly positive. Indeed, if there is a positive solution, then there is also a positive solution with distinct components as we shall see in the proof of <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/algorithm-positivisable.html" title="Algorithm A.4: Existence of a positive realization">Algorithm A.4</a>.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Deciding if a solution exists with all components strictly positive is a classical problem in linear programming. By rescaling, we may replace the open conditions \(\lambda_i &gt;0 \) with the closed conditions \(\lambda_i \geq 1\text{.}\) By a change of variables \(\mu_i=\lambda_i-1\text{,}\) we find that the linear problem for the existence of a positive realization is equivalent to an affine problem \(\mu_{i} + \mu_{j} - \mu_{h} = -1\) with all the components \(\mu_i\) non-negative.</p>
<p>Let \(A\) be the \(N \times k \)-matrix of coefficients of the affine problem and let \(\mathbf{b} = (-1,\ldots, -1) \in \mathbb{R}^N\text{.}\) By getting rid of linearly dependent equations, we may assume that \(\operatorname{rank}(A) = N \le k\text{.}\) Our goal is then an algorithm that either produces an element of the set</p>

Here we use the shorthand notation \(\mathbf{x} \ge 0 \) to mean that all the components of the vector \(\mathbf{x} \) are non-negative. Notice that the set \(P\) of solutions is closed and convex.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-constructions.html#remark-about-appendix">in-context</a></span>
