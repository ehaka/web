<p>We remark that while maximal gradings are able to detect product structures as indicated above, they are not able to detect some other algebraic properties. The Lie algebra \(L_{6,24}(1)\) in <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/Cicalo-deGraaf-Schneider-2012-6d_nilpotent_lie_algebras.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 2: Six-dimensional nilpotent Lie algebras">[2]</a> provides examples of two such phenomena. First, the layers of its maximal grading are not contained in the terms of its lower central series (this behavior can be also achieved by examples where the maximal grading is very coarse). Secondly, this Lie algebra has a “nice” basis (see <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/conti-rossi-2019-nice_lie_groups.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 10: Construction of nice nilpotent Lie groups">[10]</a> for the precise definition and its motivation), but it can be shown that no basis <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/def-grading.html" title="Definition 2.1">adapted</a> to a maximal grading is nice.</p>
