<p>To compute the precise equivalence classes, we naively check if the gradings within each family \(I_i\) are equivalent. For each pair of an \(A\)-grading \(\mathfrak{g}=\bigoplus_{\alpha\in A} V_\alpha\) and a \(B\)-grading \(\mathfrak{g}=\bigoplus_{\beta\in B} W_\beta\text{,}\) there are usually only a few homomorphisms \(f\colon A\to B\) with \(\dim V_\alpha=\dim W_{f(\beta)}\text{.}\) For each such homomorphism \(f\text{,}\) we need to check whether there exists an automorphism \(\Phi\in\Aut(\mathfrak{g})\) such that \(\Phi(V_\alpha)=W_{f(\beta)}\) for all weights \(\alpha\text{.}\) These identities define a system of quadratic equations. Since we are working over an algebraically closed field, the system has no solution if and only if 1 is contained in the ideal defined by the polynomial equations. The dimensions of the layers are generally quite small in the cases we need to check, so Gr√∂bner basis methods work well.</p>
