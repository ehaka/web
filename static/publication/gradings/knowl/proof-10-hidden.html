<body><article class="hiddenproof"><p>Let us consider the natural embedding of \(\mathbb{Z}^m\) into \(\mathbb{Q}^m\text{.}\) Using the canonical inner product \(\langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle\) on \(\mathbb{Q}^m\text{,}\) we define for each vector \(v \in \mathbb{Q}^m\text{,}\) the corresponding open half-space</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
M_v = \{x\in \mathbb{Q}^m : \langle v, x \rangle &gt; 0 \}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Denote by \(\Omega= \{\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_N\}\) the set of weights of \(\mathcal{V}\text{.}\) Recall that the convex hull of a set is the intersection of all the affine half-spaces containing the set. Hence, because the convex hull of \(\Omega\) does not contain the origin, it is contained in an open half-space \(M_{v_0} \subset \mathbb{Q}^m\text{.}\) Moreover, there exists a neighborhood \(B\) of \(v_0\) such that the convex hull of \(\Omega\) is contained in every half-space \(M_v\) with \(v\in B\text{.}\)</p>
<p>By construction all the inner products \(\langle v, \alpha_i \rangle\) with \(\alpha_i \in \Omega\) and \(v\in B\) are strictly positive. Since \(B\) has non-empty interior, we may choose some \(v\in B\) such that all the numbers \(\langle v, \alpha_1 \rangle , \ldots, \langle v, \alpha_N \rangle \) are strictly positive and distinct. Rescaling \(v\) to eliminate denominators, we obtain a vector \(\tilde{v} \in \mathbb{Z}^m\text{,}\) and the map \(f(\cdot)=\langle \tilde{v}, \cdot \rangle\) is the required homomorphism \(\mathbb{Z}^m \to \mathbb{Z}\text{.}\) Concretely, a valid vector \(\tilde{v}\) can be found directly by just enumerating the points of \(\mathbb{Z}^k\) with increasing distance from the origin and testing one by one if all the inner products with the weights are positive and distinct.</p></article></body>
