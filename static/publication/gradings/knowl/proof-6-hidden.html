<body><article class="hiddenproof"><p>Let \(\mathcal{V}\colon \mathfrak{g}=\bigoplus_{\alpha\in A}V_\alpha\) be a realization of \(\mathcal{V}\) over a torsion-free abelian group \(A\) and let \(A^*\) be the space of homomorphisms \(A\to F\text{,}\) where \(F\) is the base field of \(\mathfrak{g}\text{.}\) By reducing to the subgroup generated by the <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/def-grading.html" title="Definition 2.1">weights</a>, we may assume \(A \) is isomorphic to \(\mathbb{Z}^m\) for some \(m \ge 1\text{.}\) For each \(\varphi\in A^*\) define the linear map</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\delta_\varphi\colon\mathfrak{g}\to\mathfrak{g},\quad \delta_\varphi(X) = \varphi(\alpha)X\quad\forall X\in V_\alpha\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p data-braille="continuation">We claim that \(\mathfrak t = \{\delta_\varphi : \varphi \in A^*\} \) is a split torus that induces a realization for \(\mathcal V\text{.}\) Indeed, a direct computation shows that all the maps \(\delta_\varphi\) are derivations. They are diagonalizable since by construction they are multiples of the identity on each layer \(V_\alpha\text{.}\) Hence \(\mathfrak t\) is a split torus.</p>
<p>Let then \(\mathcal W :\mathfrak{g}=\bigoplus_{\beta\in \mathfrak t^*}W_\beta\) be the <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/def-grading.html" title="Definition 2.1">\(\mathfrak{t}^*\)-grading</a> induced by \(\mathfrak t\text{.}\) Denote by \(\Omega\) the set of weights of \(\mathcal V\text{,}\) and define a map \(f \colon  \Omega \to \mathfrak t^*\) by \(f(\alpha)(\delta_\varphi) = \varphi(\alpha)\text{.}\) Then \(f\) is well-defined: if \(\varphi, \phi \in A^*\) are such that \(\delta_\varphi = \delta_\phi\text{,}\) then by the definition of \(\mathfrak t\) we have \(\varphi(\alpha) = \phi(\alpha)\) for all weights \(\alpha \in \Omega\text{.}\)</p>
<p>First, we show that \(V_\alpha\subset W_{f(\alpha)}\) for every \(\alpha \in A\text{.}\) By the construction of the torus \(\mathfrak t\text{,}\) for each \(X\in V_\alpha\) we have that</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\delta_\varphi(X) = \varphi(\alpha)X = f(\alpha)(\delta_\varphi)X \quad \forall \delta_\varphi \in \mathfrak t.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p data-braille="continuation">By the definition of the grading \(\mathcal W\text{,}\) we then have \(X\in W_{f(\alpha)}\) and so \(V_\alpha\subset W_{f(\alpha)}\text{.}\)</p>
<p>Next, we show that the map \(f\) is injective, which would prove that \(V_\alpha = W_{f(\alpha)}\) for all \(\alpha\in \Omega\) and so \(\mathcal W\) would be a realization of \(\mathcal V \text{,}\) as claimed. Note that since \(A \) is isomorphic to \(\mathbb{Z}^m\text{,}\) for every non-zero \(\alpha \in A\) there exists a homomorphism \(\varphi \in A^*\) such that \(\varphi(\alpha)\neq 0\text{.}\) Therefore, if \(\alpha, \alpha' \in \Omega\) are such that \(f(\alpha) = f(\alpha')\text{,}\) then by the construction of the map \(f\) we have</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\varphi(\alpha-\alpha') = \varphi(\alpha)-\varphi(\alpha') = f(\alpha)(\delta_\varphi)-f(\alpha')(\delta_\varphi) = 0
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p data-braille="continuation">for every homomorphism \(\varphi\colon A\to F\text{.}\) So \(\alpha = \alpha'\) and \(f\) is injective, proving that \(\mathcal W\) is a realization of \(\mathcal V \text{.}\)</p></article></body>
