abstract: We give a short solution to one of the main open problems in subriemannian geometry. Namely, we prove that length minimizers do not have corner-type singularities. With this result we solve Problem II of Agrachevâ€™s list, and provide the first general result toward the 30-year-old open problem of regularity of subriemannian geodesics.
