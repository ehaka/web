title: Infinite geodesics in Carnot groups
event: Séminaire de Géométrie et Analyse Sous-riemannienne
event_url: https://sites.google.com/site/franceschivale/seminar
location: Paris, France
summary: ""
abstract: "Infinite geodesics in Carnot groups naturally arise as tangents to sub-Riemannian geodesics. This permits a study of the geodesic regularity problem through study of the family of all infinite geodesics. In this talk, I will present some examples of interesting behavior and cover the known results on rigidity of infinite minimizers. This talk is based on joint work with Enrico Le Donne."
