title = "Fiber bundles"
abstract = "A fiber bundle is a generalization of a product space, where one of the projections is sacrificed in order to accommodate a more interesting topological structure. Bundles supply both a wealth of examples of non-trivial topological spaces, and a convenient framework for many concepts, e.g. for vectors and derivatives on smooth manifolds. In this talk, I will give a condensed overview on the basics of the topic, and present ways to define some classical objects through the language of bundles. "
