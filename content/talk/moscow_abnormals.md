title: Sub-Riemannian abnormal extremals
event: Geometric Theory of Optimal Control
event_url: http://www.mathnet.ru/php/seminars.phtml?option_lang=eng&presentid=33194
location: Online
summary: ""
abstract: "The abnormal extremals are the obstruction to regularity of sub-Riemannian geodesics. Even in the case of 3-dimensional analytic sub-Riemannian manifolds it was only relatively recently shown by Belotto da Silva, Figalli, Parusi≈Ñski and Rifford that also the abnormal geodesics are at least C^1. In this talk I will cover some regularity results using a metric approach based on joint work with Enrico Le Donne, and cover some results studying how complicated the singularities of abnormal extremals can be."
