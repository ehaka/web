title: A metric viewpoint to sub-Riemannian optimal control
event: Geometry&Control seminar
event_url: https://people.sissa.it/~lerario/Antonio_Lerario/Seminar_Fall_2019.html
location: Trieste, Italy
summary: ""
abstract: "The regularity of solutions to Sub-Riemannian optimal control problems is a long standing open problem, of which relatively little is known. In recent years, a metric approach has proved that optimal controls cannot contain certain types of singularities, the simplest being a discrete switching point. A central object of the approach is the metric tangent cone of an optimal trajectory. This talk is based on joint work with Enrico Le Donne."
