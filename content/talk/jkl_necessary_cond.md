title: Necessary conditions for length-minimality in sub-Riemannian geometry
event: Jyv채skyl채 Geometry Seminar
event_url: http://research.jyu.fi/geomeg/seminars.php?start=2019-01-01&fin=2019-12-31
location: Jyv채skyl채, Finland
summary: ""
abstract: "The regularity of length-minimizing curves on sub-Riemannian manifolds is a mystery. In this talk, I will discuss the metric blowup approach to the problem. The key ingredients are the iterative study of tangent cones of geodesics, and the cut-and-correct method to constructing competitors to potential length-minimizers. This talk is based on joint work with Enrico Le Donne."
