I am a postdoc researcher at [SISSA](https://www.math.sissa.it/). I completed my PhD in August 2019 at the [University of Jyväskylä](https://www.jyu.fi/science/en/maths) under the supervision of [Enrico Le Donne](https://sites.google.com/site/enricoledonne/).
My work mainly revolves around the regularity of geodesics and the Sard problem in sub-Riemannian geometry, with a particular focus on the case of sub-Riemannian and sub-Finsler Carnot groups.
