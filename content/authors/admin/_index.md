I am a mathematics PhD student at the University of Jyväskylä under the supervision of Associate Professor [Enrico Le Donne](https://sites.google.com/site/enricoledonne/) since April 2015.
My thesis work is to study the regularity of geodesics and the Sard problem in sub-Riemannian geometry, with a particular focus on the case of sub-Riemannian Carnot groups.
